A PDF can be identified with the following magic strings:

1. "%PDF-"

2. "trailer"

3. "/Size"

4. "/Root"

5. "startxref"

6. "%%EOF\n"

Oh, and of course the .pdf extension in the filename...or URL

Hyperlinks in PDF can be found by searching for the "/URI" string and then iterating through the PDF file until a '(' character is found. The URL will immediately follow that and be enclosed by a ')' character.
