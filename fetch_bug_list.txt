fetch.go needs the map data structure to use the SHA256 checksum of the webpage as a key and the URL as a value. URLs are misleading.

Here is an example from an output of fetch.go that makes my point clear:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/

https://mediawiki.org/

Both lead to the EXACT same webpage yet they are different URLs. But a SHA256 checksum would make the equivalence of the two clear.

--------------------

The following lines are causing the crawler to crash at the weird URLs that do not lead anywhere:

Lines: 91, 363, 369, 381

The problem begins with the URL "https://plus.google.com/103654360130207659246"

Some complete URLS end with a ')' character and not a \".

A fair bug was found that you would not have foreseen to be fair:

1. https://reddit.com

2. https://www.reddit.com

3. https://reddit.com/

All of these are the exact same website page yet they are different URL strings.

Also the web crawler got stuck on a dynamic gif with the following URL:

The computer naturally adds a "\" to the end of each URL.

It would be best if you check if the crawler finds a URL that begins with a "www.

For now, study the dynamic HTML page "reddithelpgif.txt" And see why the annoyingly long URL "https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/frontpage-and-subscriptions/image/gif%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525253Bbase64%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252CR0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525253D%25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525253D" is causing an infinite loop.

It seems that Javascript functions are encased in <script>-like tags. How abouta map that finds the longest such script and matches it to the URL of the webpage? Clearly, although the URL or HTML content may change, the Javascript functions will not.

Wait, I have a great idea:

Extract ALL the Javascript source code from an HTML page, concatenate it together, get the SHA256 of that large string, and map it so that the return value is a 1 when there is a match. Solves the Dynamic HTML and URL problem at the same time. Although an HTML page's contents may change, the only thing I expect to remain consistent on a website is the DOM JS code itself.

After checking the reddithelpgif.txt and reddithelpgif2.txt, my theory is supported. Even the DOM JS source code remains perfectly consistent within an HTML. The only thing that truly changed in that file is the URL for that webpage. Of course, the exact Javascript source code responsible for that did not.
