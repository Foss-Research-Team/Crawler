fetch.go needs the map data structure to store the SHA256 checksum of the webpage instead of the URL. URLs are misleading.

Here is an example from an output of fetch.go that makes my point clear:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/

https://mediawiki.org/

Both lead to the EXACT same webpage. But a SHA256 checksum would make the 

equivalence of the two clear.
