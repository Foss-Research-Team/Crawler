fetch.go needs the map data structure to use the SHA256 checksum of the webpage as a key and the URL as a value. URLs are misleading.

Here is an example from an output of fetch.go that makes my point clear:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/

https://mediawiki.org/

Both lead to the EXACT same webpage yet they are different URLs. But a SHA256 checksum would make the equivalence of the two clear.
